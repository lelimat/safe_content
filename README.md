An AI tool to identify videos that are safe for kids

## Motivation
One day I saw my 5 year-old child watching a video (that was apparently meant to be made for kids)
that was talking about dating, kisses, etc.

I had also seen some videos (for kids) in the past showing people/characters with depressive thoughts and actions.
I thought it would be important to know what they were watching and decided to use AI to achieve two main goals:
1. Analyze the language of the video
    - Is the video showing language that is not safe for kids?
    - What's the main subject of the video?
    - Are there specific words I don't want my kids hearing/saying?
2. Analyze the mood/sentiment of people in the video
    - Are the people in the video usually depressive? Are they crying for no reason?
    - What's the average sentiment in the video?
    - Are the colors too depressive?

I'm trying to accomplish this with OpenAI's API for language analysis and OpenCV for image analysis.
